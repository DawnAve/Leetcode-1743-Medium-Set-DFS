# Leetcode-1743-Medium-Set-DFS
I didn't finish this one, I can't think of a way that takes less then n^2. The solution uses a dictionary, a DFS, and a recursion, and that is a lot for a medium problem. It first uses a dictionary to get the head of the array, and use DFS to get its tail, recursively.
